Lemma (GroupCategoryIdentityMorphisms)
  Suppose
    X is an object of C
  Then
    id_X:X ⟶ X in C
  Proof
    .
  Therefore
    X is an object of C

###
    Suppose
      *_G is an object of C_G
    Hence
      μ_e is an identity morphism of *_G iff μ_e = id_*_G by CanonicalFormForIdentityMorhpisms
      μ_e is an identity morphism of *_G by GroupCategoryIdentityElementsCorrespondToIdentityMorphisms
      μ_e = id_*_G by BiconditionalImplicationLeftElimination
    Then
      id_*_G is an identity morphism of *_G
    [C_G] satisfies CategoryIdentityMorphisms
